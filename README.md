# SteamMarket Analyzer

[Check it out here](https://steammarket-analyzer.herokuapp.com/).

Provides developer-focused statistics about the Steam storefront.

## Overview

Steam has long been the largest digital marketplace for PC gaming, making it a prime target for developers interested in distributing their games to a wide audience. However, the large influx of games to the platform has left many of them languishing in obscurity and has caused much frustration among devs looking to make money off of their hard work. Coupled with the fact that Steam does not provide comprehensive statistics concerning its storefront, it can be difficult for developers to gauge what kind of projects might find success on the marketplace.

That's where the **SteamMarket Analyzer** (**SMA** for short) comes in! SMA provides developers with a top-down analysis of the storefront to give them an idea of what's popular, what's not, and what games might soon be in demand. All of SMA's information is presented in a visual and easy-to-read format so that devs can get quick, daily snapshots of what the marketplace looks like and where it's heading.
